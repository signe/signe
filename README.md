- 👋 Hi, I’m @signe (Katherine)
- 👀 I’m interested in ... all sorts of things that I fail to elaborate on because I'm severely neurodivergent.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... honestly, I'm not.  Life outside work generally doesn't revolve around code because it's where I want to relax with my family and close friends.
- 📫 There are many various ways to contact me... here's a list — allmylinks.com/notyouringenue
